  - Changing typing indicator behavior or defaults
title: "Typing indicators"
---

Typing indicators are sent to the chat channel while a run is active. Use
`agents.defaults.typingMode` to control **when** typing starts and `typingIntervalSeconds`
to control **how often** it refreshes.

## Defaults

When `agents.defaults.typingMode` is **unset**, Carlito keeps the legacy behavior:

- **Direct chats**: typing starts immediately once the model loop begins.
- **Group chats with a mention**: typing starts immediately.
- **Group chats without a mention**: typing starts only when message text begins streaming.
- **Pulsecheck runs**: typing starts when the pulsecheck run begins if the
  resolved pulsecheck target is a typing-capable chat and typing is not disabled.

## Modes

Set `agents.defaults.typingMode` to one of:

- `never` — no typing indicator, ever.
- `instant` — start typing **as soon as the model loop begins**, even if the run
  later returns only the silent reply token.
- `thinking` — start typing on the **first reasoning delta** (requires
  `reasoningLevel: "stream"` for the run).
- `message` — start typing on the **first non-silent text delta** (ignores
  the `NO_REPLY` silent token).

Order of “how early it fires”:
`never` → `message` → `thinking` → `instant`

## Configuration

```json5
{
  agent: {
    typingMode: "thinking",
    typingIntervalSeconds: 6,
  },
}
```

You can override mode or cadence per session:

```json5
{
  session: {
    typingMode: "message",
    typingIntervalSeconds: 4,
  },
}
```

## Notes

- `message` mode won’t show typing for silent-only replies when the whole
  payload is the exact silent token (for example `NO_REPLY` / `no_reply`,
  matched case-insensitively).
- `thinking` only fires if the run streams reasoning (`reasoningLevel: "stream"`).
  If the model doesn’t emit reasoning deltas, typing won’t start.
- Pulsecheck typing is a liveness signal for the resolved delivery target. It
  starts at pulsecheck run start instead of following `message` or `thinking`
  stream timing. Set `typingMode: "never"` to disable it.
- Pulsechecks do not show typing when `target: "none"`, when the target cannot
  be resolved, when chat delivery is disabled for the pulsecheck, or when the
  channel does not support typing.
- `typingIntervalSeconds` controls the **refresh cadence**, not the start time.
  The default is 6 seconds.
